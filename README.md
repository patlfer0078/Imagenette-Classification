# Imagenette-Classification
Image Classification on Imagenette Dataset

Image classification I worked on at the end of 2021. This project made use of the resnet9 architecture and the Adam optimizer for gradient descents. 
The initial uploaded version is actually the 11th version of the project I created.

You can find more of this project and see comparisons on my Jovian.ai profile at https://jovian.ai/patlfer0078/deeplearning-course-project
